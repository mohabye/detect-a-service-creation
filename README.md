In this script, we first set the name of the service we want to monitor. Then, we use the Get-Service cmdlet to get a list of all services on the system. We check if the service we are monitoring exists in this list, and if it does, we check if it is set to start automatically. If it is, we display an alert indicating that malware persistence may be present.

You can customize this script by changing the name of the service you want to monitor or modifying the alert message to suit your needs. Additionally, you can set up a scheduled task to run this script periodically to continuously monitor for any changes in the service configuration
