# detect-a-service-creation
$ServiceName = "MalwareService"
This line sets the name of the service we want to monitor for malware persistence. In this case, the service name is "MalwareService", but you can change this to any service name you want to monitor.
$Services = Get-Service
This line uses the Get-Service cmdlet to get a list of all services on the system and stores the result in the $Services variable.
if ($Services.Name -contains $ServiceName) {
This line checks if the service we are monitoring for (as specified in the $ServiceName variable) exists in the list of services. If it does, the code inside the if block will be executed.
if ($Services | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq $ServiceName -and $_.StartType -eq "Automatic"}) {
Inside the if block, this line checks if the service is set to start automatically. It uses the Where-Object cmdlet to filter the list of services and returns the service where the name matches $ServiceName and the StartType property is set to "Automatic". If such a service is found, the code inside the if block will be executed.
Write-Host "ALERT: Malware persistence may be present. Service $ServiceName is set to start automatically."
Finally, if the service is found to be set to start automatically, this line displays an alert message to the console indicating that malware persistence may be present. The message includes the name of the service being monitored (as specified in the $ServiceName variable).

Overall, this PowerShell code can be used to monitor for the presence of malware persistence in the form of a service set to start automatically, and alert the user if such persistence is found.
